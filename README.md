ML-With-King-County
Machine learning with the King County housing data. The dataset contained various information on houses in King County. I wanted to see if I could create some models that will be useful in predicting the prices of expensive houses around the area. It includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015. I mainly used regression algorithms since I wanted to predict a numeric predictor “price” which I felt would be most useful.

Algorithms used were: Ordinary Least Square Regression
                      This was written in Python using Jupyter Notbook.

The data set was provided to us by our coach
